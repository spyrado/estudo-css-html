--------- contatable or uncontable -----------

Uncontable NÃO ACEITA PLURAL então quando falamos...
 There is some rice OR There isn't any rice -> está CORRETO. Não utilizamos ARE para casos incontaveis

Não podemos falar 
  - a rice pq rice é incontavel então colocamos any rice, or some rice.

Para questions utilizamos ANY nas perguntas, exemplo:
  Is there ANY meat in this dish? 

ANY -> Utilizamos para questions e negativas 
SOME -> Utilizamos para afirmativas.

POREM TEMOS UMA EXCESSÃO -> Quando eu ofereço algo em Questios, eu posso user SOME.
  EXEMPLO: 
    Would you like to drink some beer?
    Can I have some water?

Exemplos: 
  - 

Countable Singular ->
  ONE EXEMPLO: 
  AFFIRMATIVE -> a/an -> Is there an apple in this dish 
  NEGATIVE  -> a/an -> There isn't an apple in this dish.

  AFFIRMATIVE -> SOME -> There are some students in this dish
  NEGATIVE  -> ANY  
  QUESTIONS -> ANY
